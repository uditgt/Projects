[PCA - Relative Value Trading](https://github.com/uditgt/Projects/blob/main/PCA%20-%20Relative%20Value%20Trading/PCA%20-%20Relative%20Value%20Trading.ipynb)
* This is a PCA driven (unsupervised) model, which uses PCA to derive latent/state variables signifying structural movements to the interest rates at various term points along the yield curve. By using the top 3 PCA, we are in essense able to separate Noise from Signal. This can be used to build a relative value trading strategy - which is market neutral and earns alpha solely from the mispricing implied by mean-reverting noise. Or determine opportunate entry point in the market.
