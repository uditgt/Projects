[NLP & Keras - Classifying Tweets into various emotions using Bidirectional LSTM model](https://github.com/uditgt/Projects/blob/main/NLP%20%26%20Keras%20-%20Tweet%20Emotions/NLP%20%26%20Keras%20-%20Multi-class%20Tweet%20Emotions.ipynb)
* This is a multi-class classfication problem of identifying 'emotion' from a tweet's text. Each tweet can belong to one of the following six classes - joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, surprise.
* After using preprocessing functions from TensorFlow to tokenize & pad the tweets, I create a neural network comprising vector embedding layer and **Bidirectional LSTM**  layers for sequence classification, to achieve a **test accuracy of 88%**.
* The dataset is part of NLP library (also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp))
